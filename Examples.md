## example-simple
A very **minimal example** of how to use imgui within OpenFrameworks.

## example-advanced
Shows advanced use of imgui within oF, below are some covered topics :
 - oF sepcific image loading.
 - How to create helper functions (simple Dear ImGui addon).
 - How to use a Dear ImGui addon.

## example-multiwindow
How to use one ImGui instance in a multiwindow ofApp. Some bugs remain, implementation to be finished.
