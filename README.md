# ofxImGui

ofxAddon that allows you to use [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) in [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks).

### Immediate Mode Gui
Unlike most C++ gui libraries, ImGui uses the [immediate mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)) paradigm rather then being OOP (like ofxGui). In other words, every frame you rebuild the whole GUI, executing only the necessary parts, and ImGui is surprisingly fast at that ! This makes the Gui api closer to the OpenGL api as to the inner oF logic (`update()`, `draw()`, `begin()`, `end()`, `push()`, `pop()`, etc.), which makes it very smooth to integrate.  
_(Note: Internally, ImGui is not "ramming" on the CPU as most immediate-mode GUIs do)._

### ImGui Widgets
ImGui provides a lot of gui widgets/components and there's a big community with lots extensions to choose from : you will likely find any widget. In its most basic form, you get a panel with a few control widgets that control your variables, like ofxGui; but ImGui also lets you create a full application GUI layout : a menu, multiple panels, tabs and windows that you can dynamically re-arrange within your ofAppWindow or even popped-out of it. The interactions are very smooth and robust.  
A community member made [this interactive manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html) for the web browser, where you can see what ImGui looks like and the code to reproduce it.  

### ImGui API
ImGui's API is also quite nice : with very few code, you obtain a functional basic GUI component bound to your variable. You can then add arguments or extra api calls to fine-tune it (appearance, layout, interactions, feedback, etc). There's also an internal API (`imgui_internal.h`) which provides access to even more functionality and lets you build your own gui components!

### Supported Platforms
ofxImGui should run on the [latest openFrameworks release and it's OS/IDE requirements](https://openframeworks.cc/download/).  
These are typically:

 - Mac OSX, Xcode
 - Windows 10, Visual Studio
 - Raspberry Pi
 - Linux Desktop

 For more precise platform compatibility information, please refer to [PlatformSupport.md](./PlatformSupport.md).

## Install

````bash
cd /path/to/of/addons && git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui.git
````

#### Optional - Upgrade GLFW
You can configure oF to use GLFW 3.4 and ImGui will have an even more polished interface. See [Developers.md](./Developers.md#Improve-ofxImGui-s-backend-bindings).  

#### Update ofxImGui
To update ofxImGui within your openframeworks installation:

- `cd /path/to/ofxImGui && git pull && git submodule update`
- (*optional but recommended*) After updating: Add `#define IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` in your `imconfig.h` file to make sure you are not using to-be-obsoleted symbols. Update any soon-to-be obsoleted code if needed; the compilation errors will guide you to the changes to make.

## Optional - Configure ofxImGui

#### Custom project compilation flags
We try to provide the best default settings for [each platform](./PlatformSupport.md), so you should be good to go.  
If your project is using a special setup, you might need to manually set some configuration options, which are explained in [Configure.md](./Configure.md).

#### Debug compilation flags
While interfacing your ofApp with ofxImGui, a good practise is to enable `OFXIMGUI_DEBUG` together with `ofSetLogLevel(OF_LOG_VERBOSE)`, it provides some general warnings on mistakes and logs some important setup steps.

## Usage / Code Samples

### Setup
- Add a gui instance to your ofApp : `ofxImGui::Gui gui;`
- Cal `mygui.setup()`, you can pass a few arguments to setup ofxImGui to your needs :  
- `SetupState Gui::setup(BaseTheme* theme_, bool autoDraw_, ImGuiConfigFlags customFlags_, bool _restoreGuiState, bool _showImGuiMouseCursor )`
  *Arguments:**  
   - **theme** : `nullptr` : use default theme (default) / `BaseTheme*` : a pointer to your theme instance.  
   - **autoDraw** : `true` : sets up a listener on `ofApp::afterDraw()` (default) / `false` : allows more precise control over the oF rendering pipeline, you have to call `myGui.draw()` manually )
   - **customFlags** : `ImGuiConfigFlags` : set custom ImGui config flags (default: `ImGuiConfigFlags_None`).
   - **restoreGuiState** : `true` : enabled / `false` : disabled (default).  
   Helper for enabling ImGui's layout saving/restoring feature. Creates `imgui.ini` next to your app binary to save some GUI parameters.
   - **showImGuiMouseCursor** : `true` : use the imgui mouse cursor / `false` : use system mouse cursor (default).
  **Return value:**  
  The setup function returns an `ofxImGui::SetupState` indicating if the setup failed succeeded as a slave or master.  
   - `if( gui->setup(...) & ofxImGui::SetupState::Success ) // I'm either a slave or a master`   
   - `if( gui->setup(...) & ofxImGui::SetupState::Slave   ) // Setup as slave : some requested parameters might have been ignored and there's other code using ofxImGui.`
   - `if( gui->setup(...) & ofxImGui::SetupState::Master  ) // Setup as master : You were the first to create a GUI instance in this ofApp.`   
   - `if(  gui->setup(...) ) // Same as success`  
   - `if( !gui->setup(...) ) // There was an error`

ofxImGui implements DearImGui in such a way that each oF window gets its own imgui context, seamlessly shared between any oF window context. You can also load multiple instances of it in the same ofApp (to use the addon within multiple addons). This feature (shared mode) is automatically enabled when a second `ofxImGui::Gui` instance is created within the same `ofApp` application's platform window context. See example-sharedContext for more info.  
_Note:_ Only the fist call to `gui.setup()` has full control over the settings (master); the next ones setup as slaves.  
_Note:_ Any call to `setup()` has to be done from a valid ofWindow, `ofGetWindowPtr()` is used internally to associate the gui context to that exact ofWindow. Therefore, **you cannot setup ofxImGui before OpenFrameworks' setup() calls**.  

**Advanced setup** : ImGui config flags & ImGui::GetIO()

ofxImGui provides a simple way to interface ImGui, but it's a huge library providing lots of different options to suit your precise needs.  
Most of these advanced options are explained in the `imgui_demo.cpp` source code. Also checkout `example-dockingandviewports` and `example-advanced`.  
Some options are: Docking, viewports, custom fonts, and other configuration flags.

### Draw a window (optional)
If you don't call any window, ImGui will automatically create a dummy window named "Debug".
- Create a window : `ImGui::Begin("MyWindow"); /* Draw widgets here... */ ImGui::End();`
- Submit GUI only when window content is visible : `if(ImGui::Begin("MyWindow")){ /* Draw widgets here... */ } ImGui::End();`
- You can resume drawing to a window : `ImGui::Begin("MyWindow"); /* Start fill MyWindow */ ImGui::End(); ImGui::Begin("OtherWindow"); /* Fill OtherWindow */ ImGui::End(); ImGui::Begin("MyWindow"); /* Append to MyWindow */ ImGui::End();`

### Draw Gui Components
In your ofApp::draw(), call `ofAppGui.begin();` and `ofAppGui.end();`. In-between you can submit widgets.

**Important**: Each interactive imgui widget needs to have a unique ID within the ImGui ID stack. This can be a `char*` or a `void*` that has a static memory address that won't move over time.  
For example, using `std::list` is fine: you can use the item as a pointer, but not for `std::vector` as items can be reallocated on the fly.

Some simple components:
- `ImGui::Text("Some static text");`
- `ImGui::Text("Some dynamic text: %s", myString.c_str() ); // std::string ofApp::myString;`
- `ImGui::Checkbox("A checkbox", &myBool); // bool ofApp::myBool;`
- `ImGui::DragInt("An integer", &myInt); // int ofApp::myInt;`

Checkout the imgui demo window to discover all available widgets !

### Customise components
- `ImGui::BeginDisabled(); /* Some disabled widgets here */ ImGui::EndDisabled();`
- `PushItemWidth(50); /* Some compact widgets here */ PopItemWidth();`
- `ImGui::Text("Push here -->"); ImGui::SameLine(); ImGui::Button("<-- Text there");`
- `ImGui::Indent(); /* Some indented widgets here */ ImGui::Unindent();`


### ofxImGuiHelpers
The helpers are a collection of glue samples for integrating OpenFrameworks objects into ImGui.
Amongst others, it makes porting ofxGui apps to ofxImGui easier as it implements a compatibility layer for ofParameter.  
To use the helpers, you need this : `#include "ImHelpers.h"`.

## Community

### ImGui extensions
- Most imgui extensions should be useable by simply including them into your project. Here's [a list of them](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Useful-Extensions) but there are many more around [on github](https://github.com/search?q=+topic%3Aimgui&type=repositories) !

#### ofxImGui extensions
- [moebiussurfing/ofxSurfingImGui](https://github.com/moebiussurfing/ofxSurfingImGui/): An extension to this addon which facilitates advanced integration with ofApps while also making the UI more user-friendly. It embeds a presets system, and embeds many 3rd party ui widgets.
- [ofxImGuizmo](https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxImGuizmo) The ImGuizmo extension shipped as an ofxAddon, for displaying a 3d point handle.

#### ofxAddons providing ofxImGui integration
